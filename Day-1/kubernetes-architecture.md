# Introduction to Kubernetes

## 1. What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  
It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.  

At its core, Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems reliably, handling failures, scaling workloads, and managing service discovery seamlessly.

## 2. Why Kubernetes?
Before Kubernetes, running containers at scale was challenging — managing networking, scaling, and failover often required significant manual effort or custom scripts.

Kubernetes solves these problems by:
- **Automating deployments** so you can focus on code, not infrastructure.
- **Scaling applications automatically** based on resource usage or demand.
- **Ensuring high availability** with self-healing capabilities.
- **Abstracting infrastructure** so workloads can run anywhere — on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid environments.

By adopting Kubernetes, organizations can speed up development cycles, improve resource utilization, and achieve consistent application management across environments.

## 3. Key Features
- **Automatic Scaling** – Scale applications up or down based on demand (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
- **Self-Healing** – Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces Pods, and reschedules workloads on healthy nodes.
- **Load Balancing & Service Discovery** – Distributes traffic evenly and provides stable endpoints for services.
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks** – Update applications with zero downtime and revert changes if needed.
- **Secret & Configuration Management** – Manage sensitive data and application configs securely.
- **Storage Orchestration** – Automatically mount storage systems like EBS, NFS, or cloud-native volumes.

## 4. How Kubernetes Works (High-Level)
Kubernetes uses a **cluster** of machines (nodes) and separates responsibilities between the **control plane** and **worker nodes**:

- **Control Plane**  
  - **API Server** – Central communication hub for all cluster operations.  
  - **Scheduler** – Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource availability.  
  - **Controller Manager** – Monitors and enforces desired cluster state.  
  - **etcd** – Key-value store holding cluster configuration and state.

- **Worker Nodes**  
  - **Kubelet** – Agent that ensures containers are running in Pods as expected.  
  - **Kube-proxy** – Handles network traffic routing to Pods.  
  - **Container Runtime** – Runs containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).

- **Pods** – The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers with shared networking and storage.

## 5. Kubernetes in the Cloud
While Kubernetes can be installed on-premises, many organizations choose **managed Kubernetes services** to reduce operational overhead. Popular options include:
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** – Fully managed Kubernetes control plane on AWS.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** – Managed Kubernetes with deep Google Cloud integration.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** – Microsoft’s managed Kubernetes solution.

**Benefits of managed services:**
- Automatic control plane upgrades and patching.
- Built-in integration with cloud provider networking, storage, and security.
- Reduced operational burden, allowing teams to focus on workloads.
